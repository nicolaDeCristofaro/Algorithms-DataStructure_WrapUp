# Array

## DVD box - real world example
Suppose you had a bunch of DVDs at home that you wanted to arrange neatly. What would be the ideal choice for storing such a thing? You could find a cardboard box (or some other box) big enough to arrange all the DVDs neatly, right? It's as simple as that. However, you might want to add a new DVD to the box, or you might want to get rid of the old ones that you've watched a million times over in the past. An important consideration for this box would be that you would only place DVDs in it and nothing else; you wouldn't place your clothes in it, for example. The box would contain multiple items, but all of them would be of the same type. In this case, that type is DVD. Items of the same type share properties. For DVDs, those properties include:

- All the DVDs would be inside a plastic cover.
- The cover would have the name of the movie, the cast, and all sorts of other details.
- All the covers would be of exactly the same size and would contain just one, and only one, DVD.

You might not actually name the DVD box, but when you want your sister to fetch a DVD, you'd tell her that the DVD is inside your "DVD box", and she would instantly know where to find the box. This is a very simple yet realistic scenario that is easy to understand and relate to. So, now let us move over to the world of computers and port this example to programming.

Suppose you were told that you needed to build some software to keep track of all the DVDs in an inventory. This is the exact same scenario that we just described above, but on a much larger scale. So let's imagine the DVD box as a virtual DVD library. For each DVD, you would have certain properties that would be specific attributes of the movies themselves.

In addition to the properties of a DVD, you're also told the maximum number of DVDs that can be stored in the inventory. Obviously, you wouldn't want to store ancient movies from the 1900s unless they were popular ones, right? Say you were told that the requirement is to maintain a maximum inventory of just 100 DVDs. This is an important piece of information because, without this, you wouldn't be able to find the perfectly sized box to fit all the DVDs easily. How could we find a box of a particular size that would be able to fit a maximum of 100 DVDs? Well, lucky for us, we don't need to physically find a cardboard box or anything—there's a programming construct for this purpose. That programming construct is known as an Array.

## What is an Array?

```
An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, books—anything really. The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.
```

So, how can we relate this back to the physical DVDs? Well, do you keep your DVDs all around the house in multiple locations? Hopefully not! Most people keep all of their DVDs right next to one another inside one gigantic box, or perhaps on a bookshelf. We do this so that if we need to find a particular DVD, we can quickly search through all of them without running from room to room.

### Creating an Array
On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the programmer, at the time you create the Array. This is the same as when we found a big enough cardboard box for the DVDs. Additionally, you also need to specify the type of item that will be going into the Array.

In Java, we use the following code to create an Array to hold up to 15 DVDs. Note that we've also included a simple definition of a DVD for clarity.

```java
// The actual code for creating an Array to hold DVD's.
DVD[] dvdCollection = new DVD[15];

// A simple definition for a DVD.
public class DVD {
    public String name;
    public int releaseYear;
    public String director;

    public DVD(String name, int releaseYear, String director) {
        this.name = name;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.director = director;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", directed by " + this.director + ", released in " + this.releaseYear;
    }
}
```

After running the above code, we now have an Array called dvdCollection, with 15 places in it. Each place can hold one DVD. At the start, there are no DVD's in the Array; we'll have to actually put them in.

The Array can only hold up to 15 DVDs. If we get a 16th DVD, we'll need to make a new Array. We'll look at how we deal with running out of space, in the next chapter.

Before we move onto actually putting some DVDs into the Array, though, one thing you might be wondering is why we'd make an Array with only 15 places. Why not just make it hold 1000000 DVDs so that we know for sure we'll always have enough space?

Well, the reason is the same as it is for the physical box of DVDs. Do you really want to find a box that could hold 1000000 DVDs when you currently only have 15 DVDs and, in fact, never expect to own more than 100 of them? Is it even worth getting a box that could hold 100 DVDs right now, when you only expect to get a few new ones each year? It will take up a lot more space in your home in the meantime.

It's exactly the same with the Array, where the space in your home is analogous to memory on the computer. If you make an Array with 1000000 spaces, the computer will reserve memory to hold 1000000 DVDs, even if you only put 15 DVDs into it. That memory can't be used for anything else in the meantime—just like the space in your house that has been taken over by that huge cardboard box!

## Accessing Elements in Arrays

```
The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them. All other Array operations are built on top of these two primitive operations.
```

### Writing Items into an Array

To put a DVD into the Array, we need to decide which of the 15 places we'd like it to go in. Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of 0 to N - 1. The 1st place is 0, the 2nd place is 1, the 3rd place is 2... all the way up to the 15th place, which is 14. We call these numbers that identify each place indexes.

Let's put the DVD for The Avengers into the eighth place of the Array we created above.

```java
// Firstly, we need to actually create a DVD object for The Avengers.
DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("The Avengers", 2012, "Joss Whedon");

// Next, we'll put it into the 8th place of the Array. Remember, because we
// started numbering from 0, the index we want is 7.
dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;
```

And that's it. We've put the DVD for The Avengers into our Array! Let's put a few more DVD's in.

```java
DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton");
DVD lionKingDVD = new DVD("The Lion King", 2019, "Jon Favreau");

// Put "The Incredibles" into the 4th place: index 3.
dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;

// Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;

// Put "The Lion King" into the 3rd place: index 2.
dvdCollection[2] = lionKingDVD;
```

Notice that we put The Incredibles into the Array at index 3. What happens if we now run this next piece of code?

```java
DVD starWarsDVD = new DVD("Star Wars", 1977, "George Lucas");
dvdCollection[3] = starWarsDVD;
```

Because we just put Star Wars into the Array at index 3, The Incredibles is no longer in the Array. It has been overwritten! If we still have the incrediblesDVD variable in scope, then the DVD still exists in the computer's memory. If not though, it's totally gone!

### Reading Items from an Array

We can check what's at a particular Array index.

```java
// Print out what's in indexes 7, 10, and 3.
System.out.println(dvdCollection[7]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[10]);
System.out.println(dvdCollection[3]);

// Will print:

// The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, released in 2012
// null
// Star Wars, directed by George Lucas, released in 1977
```
Notice that because we haven't yet put anything at index 10, the value it contains is null. In other languages, such as C, the Array slot could contain completely random data. Java always initializes empty Array slots to null if the Array contains objects, or to default values if it contains primitive types. For example, the array int [] would contain the default value of 0 for each element, float[] would contain default values of 0.0, and bool[] would contain default values of false.

### Writing Items into an Array with a Loop

We commonly use a loop to put lots of values into an Array. To illustrate this, let's go to another example. This time, we're going to create an Array of ints and put the first 10 square numbers into it.

```java
int[] squareNumbers = new int[10];

// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // We need to be careful with the 0-indexing. The next square number
    // is given by (i + 1) * (i + 1).
    // Calculate it and insert it into the Array at index i.
    int square = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
    squareNumbers[i] = square;
}

```
### Reading Items from an Array with a Loop
We can also use a loop to print out everything that's in the Array.

```java
// Go through each of the Array indexes, from 0 to 9.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Access and print what's at the i'th index.
    System.out.println(squareNumbers[i]);
}

// Will print:
// 1
// 4
// 9
// 16
// 25
// 36
// 49
// 64
// 81
// 100
```

One last thing worth knowing now is that there's a more elegant way of printing out the values of an Array—a variant of the for loop, commonly referred to as a "for each" loop.

```java
// For each VALUE in the Array.
for (int square : squareNumbers) {
    // Print the current value of square.
    System.out.println(square);
}
// Prints exactly the same as the previous example.
```
You'll probably agree that this code is a lot simpler to read. We can use it whenever we don't need the index values. For actually writing the squares into the Array, it wouldn't have worked because we needed to work with the actual index numbers. You don't have to use a "for each" loop when you're starting out, but we recommend you become comfortable with it before interviews. Simple, elegant code is good code!

## Array Capacity VS Length

If somebody asks you how long the DVD Array is, what would your answer be? There are two different answers you might have given.

1. The number of DVDs the box could hold, if it was full, or
2. The number of DVDs currently in the box.

Both answers are correct, and both have very different meanings! It's important to understand the difference between them, and use them correctly. We call the first one the capacity of the Array, and the second one the length of the Array.

### Array Capacity
Let's say we've created a new Array like this.

```java
DVD[] array = new DVD[6]
```
Is it a valid operation to insert an element at array[6]? What about at array[10]?

Nope, neither of these are valid. When we created the Array, we specified that it can hold up to 6 DVD's. This is the Array's capacity.

Remembering that indexing starts at 0, we can only insert items at array[0], array[1], array[2], array[3], array[4], and array[5]. Trying to put an element anywhere else, such as array[-3], array[6], or array[100] will cause your code to crash with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException!

The Array's capacity must be decided when the Array is created. The capacity cannot be changed later. Going back to our DVD's-in-a-cardboard-box-analogy, changing the capacity of an Array would be akin to trying to make a cardboard box bigger. Trying to make a fixed-size cardboard box bigger is impractical, and it's the same as an Array on a computer!

So, what do we do if we get a 7th DVD and we'd like all our DVD's in the same Array? Well, unfortunately it's the same as it is with our cardboard box. We'll need to go get a larger one, and then move all the existing DVD's into it, along with the new one.

The capacity of an Array in Java can be checked by looking at the value of its length attribute. This is done using the code arr.length, where arr is the name of the Array. Different programming languages have different ways of checking the length of an Array.

```java
int capacity = array.length;
System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + capacity);
```
Running this code will give the following output:
```
The Array has a capacity of 6
```
Yup, it's a bit confusing that you need to access the capacity of an Array by using .length. Unfortunately, this is just something you'll need to get used to.

### Array length
The other definition of length is the number of DVDs, or other items, currently in the Array. This is something you'll need to keep track of yourself, and you won't get any errors if you overwrite an existing DVD, or if you leave a gap in the Array.

You might have noticed that we've been using a length variable in our previous examples, to keep track of the next empty index.

```java
// Create a new array with a capacity of 6.
int[] array = new int[6];

// Current length is 0, because it has 0 elements.
int length = 0;

// Add 3 items into it.
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    array[i] = i * i;
    // Each time we add an element, the length goes up by one.
    length++;
}

System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + array.length);
System.out.println("The Array has a length of " + length);
```
Running this code will give the following output:
```
The Array has a capacity of 6
The Array has a length of 3
```

### Handling Array Parameters
Most Array questions on LeetCode have an Array passed in as a parameter, with no "length" or "capacity" parameter. What do we mean by this? Well, let's look at an example. Here is the description for the first problem you'll be asked to solve.
```
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
```
And here is the code template you're given.

The only parameter is nums; an Array. You couldn't possibly solve this question without knowing how long nums is. Well, luckily it's straightforward. When an Array is given as a parameter, without any additional information, you can safely assume that length == capacity. That is, the Array is the exact right size to hold all of its data. We can, therefore, use .length.

Be careful though, Array's are 0-indexed. The capacity/ length is a number of items, not a highest index. The highest index is .length - 1. Therefore, to iterate over all items in the Array, we can do the following.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        // Hint: Initialise and declare a variable here to 
        // keep track of how many 1's you've seen in a row.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Do something with element nums[i].
        }
    }
}
```
And that is the basics of Arrays that you'll need to get started! These are some coding problems on Array basics:

- [Max Consecutive Ones](./Problems/MaxConsecutiveOnes.java) 
- [Find numbers with even number of digits](./Problems/EvenNumbersOfDigits.java) 
- [Squares of a sorted Array](./Problems/SquaresOfSortedArray.java)

## Basic Array Operations
Now that we have a fairly good understanding of what an Array actually is, and how it is stored inside the computer's physical memory, the next important thing to look at is all the operations that Arrays support. An Array is a data structure, which means that it stores data in a specific format and supports certain operations on the data it stores. Consider the DVD inventory management software from the introduction section. Let's look at some operations you might want to perform using this software:

- Insert a new DVD into the collection at a specific location.
- Delete a DVD from the existing collection if it doesn't make sense to keep it in the inventory anymore.
- Search for a particular DVD in the collection. This is one of the most commonly executed operation on our collection, because our inventory management software would be used hundreds of times a day to look for a particular DVD asked for by the user.

### Array Insertion
Inserting a new element into an Array can take many forms:

1.Inserting a new element at the end of the Array.
2.Inserting a new element at the beginning of the Array.
3.Inserting a new element at any given index inside the Array.

#### Inserting at the End of an Array
At any point in time, we know the index of the last element of the Array, as we've kept track of it in our length variable. All we need to do for inserting an element at the end is to assign the new element to one index past the current last element.

Here's the code to make a new Array that can hold up to 6 items, and then add items into the first 3 three indexes.

```java
// Declare an integer array of 6 elements
int[] intArray = new int[6];
int length = 0;

// Add 3 elements to the Array
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    intArray[length] = i;
    length++;
}
```
Let's define a function, printArray, to help us visualise what's happening.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < intArray.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Index " + i + " contains " + intArray[i]);
}
```
If we run our printArray function, we'll get the following output.

```
Index 0 contains 0.
Index 1 contains 1.
Index 2 contains 2.
Index 3 contains 0.
Index 4 contains 0.
Index 5 contains 0.
```
Notice how indexes 3, 4, and 5 all contain 0? This is because Java fills unused int Array slots with 0s.

Let's now add a 4th element. We'll add the number 10.
```java
// Insert a new element at the end of the Array. Again,
// it's important to ensure that there is enough space
// in the array for inserting a new element.
intArray[length] = 10;
length++;
```
Notice how we also incremented the length? This is very important, next time when we add another element, we'll accidentally overwrite the one we just added!

Running printArray again, we'll get the following:
```
Index 0 contains 0.
Index 1 contains 1.
Index 2 contains 2.
Index 3 contains 10.
Index 4 contains 0.
Index 5 contains 0.
```

#### Inserting at the start of an Array
To insert an element at the start of an Array, we'll need to shift all other elements in the Array to the right by one index to create space for the new element. This is a very costly operation, since each of the existing elements has to be shifted one step to the right. The need to shift everything implies that this is not a constant time operation. In fact, the time taken for insertion at the beginning of an Array will be proportional to the length of the Array. **In terms of time complexity analysis, this is a linear time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the Array.**

Here's what this looks like in code.

```java
// First, we will have to create space for a new element.
// We do that by shifting each element one index to the right.
// This will firstly move the element at index 3, then 2, then 1, then finally 0.
// We need to go backwards to avoid overwriting any elements.
for (int i = 3; i >= 0; i--) {
    intArray[i + 1] = intArray[i];
}

// Now that we have created space for the new element,
// we can insert it at the beginning.
intArray[0] = 20;
```

#### Inserting Anywhere in the Array
Similarly, for inserting at any given index, we first need to shift all the elements from that index onwards one position to the right. Once the space is created for the new element, we proceed with the insertion. If you think about it, insertion at the beginning is basically a special case of inserting an element at a given index—in that case, the given index was 0.

Again, this is also a costly operation since we could potentially have to shift almost all the other elements to the right before actually inserting the new element. As your saw above, shifting lots of elements one place to the right adds to the time complexity of the insertion task.

Here's what it looks like in code.

```java
// Say we want to insert the element at index 2.
// First, we will have to create space for the new element.
for (int i = 4; i >= 2; i--)
{
    // Shift each element one position to the right.
    intArray[i + 1] = intArray[i];
}

// Now that we have created space for the new element,
// we can insert it at the required index.
intArray[2] = 30;
```
The main thing to be careful of is remembering that array.length gives you the total capacity of the Array. If you want to know the last used slot, you'll need to keep track of this yourself using a length variable. Other than that, just be careful to read any elements you want to keep, before you overwrite them!

These are some coding problems on Array Insertion:

- [Duplicate Zeros](./Problems/DuplicateZeros.java) 
- [Merge Sorted Array]()
